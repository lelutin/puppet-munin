#
# Parameters:
# $is_server  - determines whether or not to install munin server. munin-node is
#               required for the server so it is always installed.
# $export_tag - tag exported resources so that only the server targeted by that
#               tag will collect them. This can let you install multiple munin
#               servers.
#
# Client-specific parameters:
# $allow, $host, $host_name, $port, $use_ssh, $manage_shorewall,
# $shorewall_collector_source, $description, $munin_group
#
# Server-specific parameters:
# $cgi_graphing, cgi_owner
